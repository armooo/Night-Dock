Night Dock is a simple program to disable sounds when your phone is docked.
This way you can get a good night sleep, and still wake up in the morning.

After cloning run "android update project -p . -t android-6" to setup
local.properties. Then a normal ant debug or ant install will work.

If you are using eclipse I can't help you but there must be some way to import
it.
